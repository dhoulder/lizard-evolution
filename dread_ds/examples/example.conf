### Example config file
#
# Comments are prefixed with a #-character and can be inserted anywhere.
# [something] starts a section.
# key=value specifies a value for an option. Within a [section], this is
# equivalent to the command line syntax section.key=value.
# Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from both keys and values.
# There is no quoting syntax, thus no way to specify a literal
# #-character, nor explicit leading or trailing spaces. See
