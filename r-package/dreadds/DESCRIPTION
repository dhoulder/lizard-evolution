Description: Implements a spatially explicit dynamic intraspecific
        macroevolutionary model to simulate expected spatial
        patterns of species and phylogenetic diversity. The primary
        purpose is to select appropriate models which
        generate expected spatial patterns best matching observed
        diversity. Used to determine the processes responsible for the
        spatial distribution of biological diversity and phylogenetic
        endemism.
