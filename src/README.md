DREaD_ds C++ implementation
============================

This directory contains C++ source code that implements the DREaD_ds
evolution model. See ../README.md

The model implemented here is intended to closely match the model
implemented by ../DREaD_ds.R, but in a language that allows for
greater computational performance and efficiency.

R is still used for model input data, model configuration and
visualisation.
